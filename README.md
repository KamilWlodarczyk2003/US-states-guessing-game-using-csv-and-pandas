# State Guessing Name

Simple state guessing game made in python using turtle and pandas library.  
It imports a data from csv file that contains name of states and their x,y coords that correspond to a position of states on a photo.  
You can type "Exit" in an input window to exit a game. After that it will create a csv file of states that you didn't guess.
